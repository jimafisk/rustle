# Rustle

The Svelte compiler, rewritten in Rust.

## Description

This projects aims to make `Svelte` usable without `Node.js` and make the compiler _blazingly fast_.

## Work in progress

This is still a big work in progress. Only a few parts of Svelte are working now and the CLI tool still needs some work.

# Getting started

### Installation

To install with cargo, run `cargo install rustle_cli` to install the alpha version of the CLI.

### Using rustle_cli

Run `rustle_cli app.rustle` to generate an `app.js` file. You can optionally specify a different output file with the `-o` flag.

You can also specify a directory for example `rustle_cli src` to parse all the files in that directory.

For debugging, you can print the generated AST with the `-a` or `--ast` flag and pretty print it with `-p`.

# Development

A lot of features still need to be implemented before `rustle` is ready for use. Check the examples folder or `rustle/tests` to get a better look at currently is supported:

- [x] on:click event handler
- [x] arrow function with single assignment
- [x] display variable (eg. {counter})
- [x] scoped CSS
- [x] reactive declarations (currently only simple assignment declarations work)

Feature roadmap:
- [ ] Dynamic attributes ({class} instead of class={class})
- [x] Styling (&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;)
- [ ] Nested components
- [ ] HTML tags ({@html htmlString})
